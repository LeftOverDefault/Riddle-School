## Plot

The game begins of from where we were last time, in Diz's spaceship, heading to earth, after Phil destroyed Viz. However, on there way to earth, the ship gets controlled, and brought to Zone 5.1, where Diz and the kids are arrested by the FBI. Phil wakes up in his cell, saying, "I was hoping for a new beginning. I just didn't think it'd look like this." Phil then escapes his cell by using a flusher handle and a television screen with his cell code. After escaping, he eventually rescues Smiley, Zack, and Phred. After coming to the Diz's place, Phil finds out that the researchers of Zone 5.1 are looking for information about Vizion. However, Vizion is supposed to be dead, because Phil killed Viz, ending Vizion. Unless someone else came into play...well, Phil didn't care anyways, because he cam here to free Diz. After doing so, they go the ship- only for the alarms to alert and Diz abandoning them. Eventually, Phil and his friends go into the sewers, ending the game.
